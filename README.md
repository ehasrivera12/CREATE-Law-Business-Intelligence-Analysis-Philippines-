## 📘 What is This Project?

This project analyzes the impact of **Republic Act No. 11534 (CREATE Law)** on Philippine businesses using a realistic, simulated SQL dataset with 5,000 rows.  
The goal is to provide **data-driven business decisions** based on key indicators like revenue growth, tax savings, industry incentives, and MSME scaling.

## 🏢 Why This Project Matters

The CREATE Law was designed to:
- Lower corporate income taxes
- Encourage investments via tax incentives
- Boost competitiveness of MSMEs and industries

Yet many companies still haven’t leveraged the law’s full benefits. This project offers insights that could **guide policy makers, tax consultants, executives, and startups** in making strategic decisions.
