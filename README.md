# CREATE Intelligence: Leveraging RA 11534 for Smarter Business Decisions
## 🧠 Project Summary
This project explores the **Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act** of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 11534) and uses **SQL and synthetic data** to simulate how different industries, business sizes, and locations can benefit from the law’s tax reforms and incentives.
As of today, many businesses are still navigating how this law can benefit them. This project bridges the gap by creating a decision-making model through data—helping companies simulate **"what-if" tax incentive outcomes** and explore the real-world financial impact of the CREATE Act.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters
The CREATE Law represents the most significant reform in the Philippine tax incentive system in recent years. It:
- Lowers corporate income tax from 30% to 20% (for MSMEs).
- Offers perormance-based, time-bound, and targeted tax incentives.
- Introduces fiscal support for startups and digital-based companies.

However, **many enterprises are unaware** of the law's potential when it comes to optimizing business strategy, expansion, or sectoral growth. This project offers a **data-driven guide** to:
- Identify industries that benefit the most
- Help CFOs/finance teams simulate future tax savings
- Provide open-ended insights for policymakers and private sector stakeholders

## 🔍 Business Questions Answered (SQL Analysis)
1. How much would a business have paid before CREATE vs. after?
2. Which regions have the most businesses receiving incentives?
3. What is the ROI of tax incentives across sectors?
4. How many MSMEs were able to grow into large businesses after CREATE?
5. Which industries gained the most savings after the CREATE Act?

## 🏢 Why This Project Matters

The CREATE Law was designed to:
- Lower corporate income taxes
- Encourage investments via tax incentives
- Boost competitiveness of MSMEs and industries

Yet many companies still haven’t leveraged the law’s full benefits. This project offers insights that could **guide policy makers, tax consultants, executives, and startups** in making strategic decisions.
