## 📘 What is This Project?

This project analyzes the impact of **Republic Act No. 11534 (CREATE Law)** on Philippine businesses using a realistic, simulated SQL dataset with 5,000 rows.  
The goal is to provide **data-driven business decisions** based on key indicators like revenue growth, tax savings, industry incentives, and MSME scaling.

---

## 🏢 Why This Project Matters

The CREATE Law was designed to:
- Lower corporate income taxes
- Encourage investments via tax incentives
- Boost competitiveness of MSMEs and industries

Yet many companies still haven’t leveraged the law’s full benefits. This project offers insights that could **guide policy makers, tax consultants, executives, and startups** in making strategic decisions.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset simulates businesses across 10 industries and regions in the Philippines from 2018 to 2024. It includes:

- `business_id`, `name`, `industry`, `region`, `size`, `start_year`
- Yearly `gross_revenue` and `net_income`
- Applied `tax_incentives` and `estimated_savings`
- Historical `corporate_tax_rates` (before/after CREATE)

> ✅ **Combined into one CSV for faster analysis:** `create_law_combined_dataset.csv`

## 🎯 Business Problems Answered

- **Which sectors benefit the most from CREATE tax cuts?**
- **Are MSMEs scaling faster due to incentives?**
- **Which regions maximize tax holidays or special rates?**
- **How much tax has been saved nationwide since 2021?**

## 🔍 Business-Impacting SQL Queries

This project goes beyond raw data — it answers **strategic business questions** using MySQL, aligned with the intent of the CREATE Law.

### 📊 1. Compare Tax Before and After CREATE Law (Per Industry)
```sql
SELECT 
  industry,
  year,
  ROUND(SUM(net_income * corp_tax_before), 2) AS tax_before_create,
  ROUND(SUM(net_income * corp_tax_after), 2) AS tax_after_create,
  ROUND(SUM(net_income * (corp_tax_before - corp_tax_after)), 2) AS tax_savings
FROM 
  create_law_combined_dataset
WHERE 
  year >= 2021
GROUP BY 
  industry, year
ORDER BY 
  year, tax_savings DESC;
